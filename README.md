Created a Deep Learning model which classifies breed of a dog. Data set is taken from a kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/dog-breed-identification/data: 

train.zip - the training set, you are provided the breed for these dogs

test.zip - the test set, you must predict the probability of each breed for each image

sample_submission.csv - a sample submission file in the correct format

labels.csv - the breeds for the images in the train set

Everyting has been done in the Google Colab
